# Figurine-Quest

Figurine Quest was a small adventure game created over the Christmas 2020 break to keep my Python skills sharp. I had two goals for this project. The first was to see if I could build the systems to support the classic adventure game set of commands like n, e, s, w, look, and so on. The second was to provide a fun thing for my mother who I was staying with for Christmas.

To that end, the game is quite basic and won't present a challenge to experienced players. It's 17 rooms in size, but the rooms are relatively empty and free of red herrings. The setting is the house I was staying at for Christmas at the time.
